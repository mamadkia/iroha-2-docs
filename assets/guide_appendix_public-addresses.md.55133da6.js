The <code>API_URL</code> is the location to which the client(s) make their requests. You can use it to change some peer-specific configuration options too. While we could give you the examples here, the only up-to-date description can be found in the Iroha\u2019s immediate <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/docs/source/references/api_spec.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation on GitHub</a>. Most of the time, the only reason to change the <code>API_URL</code> is to change the port, in case <code>8080</code> is either closed, or if you want to randomise ports to avoid certain kinds of attacks. The <code>P2P_ADDR</code> is the internal address used for communication between peers. Take note of <strong>this address</strong> for inclusion in the <code>TRUSTED_PEERS</code> section of the configuration file. Lastly, (and not in the example configuration) you have the prometheus endpoint address. It\u2019s set by adding a value <code>&quot;TELEMETRY_URL&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1:8180&quot;</code>, to the <code>TORII</code> section. It\u2019s not meant to be human-readable, but a <code>GET</code> request to the <code>127.0.0.1:8180/status</code> will give you a JSON-encoded representation of the top-level metrics, while a <code>GET</code> request to <code>127.0.0.1:8180/metrics</code> will give you a (somewhat verbose) list of all available metrics gathered in Iroha. You might want to change this, if you\u2019re having trouble gathering metrics using <code>prometheus</code>.</p>',2),n=[s];function r(c,d,h,u,l,p){return t(),o("div",null,n)}var g=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
